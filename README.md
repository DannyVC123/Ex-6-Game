# Pacman Game

## Aesthetic Goals:
### Goal 1: Challenge

**Definition:** A game is challenging if it requires the player to use skillful decision-making, quick reflexes, and strategic thinking to overcome obstacles within the game. The difficulty should be present throughout the gameplay, providing constant tension and engagement while testing the player’s abilities.

#### Success:
- The game should maintain a high level of challenge by introducing dynamic obstacles, such as aggressive or unpredictable enemies.
- Players must balance risk and reward, making decisions that require careful planning and quick reactions to succeed.
- The game should offer strategic opportunities, such as utilizing the environment or timing to outmaneuver enemies.
- The player should feel consistently engaged, with moments of tension that challenge their reflexes and decision-making, keeping the experience exciting.

#### Failure:
- The game is too easy, with little need for skill or strategic thinking, resulting in a lack of challenge.
- The difficulty is stagnant or trivial, with no real obstacles or threats that create tension or test the player.
- The obstacles or enemies are too predictable or passive, causing the player to feel like success is guaranteed without significant effort.

### Goal 2: Replayability
**Definition:** A game is replayable if the player can enjoy playing it repeatedly, with each playthrough offering a fresh and unique experience. While the player’s skill may improve over time, the game should retain enough variation and novelty to feel engaging, preventing the experience from becoming repetitive.

#### Success:
- The game offers variations in gameplay, whether through randomized elements (such as map layout, enemy behavior, or power-up placements) or evolving challenges that encourage the player to keep coming back.
- The player can approach the game differently with each playthrough, whether by experimenting with new strategies or discovering new outcomes in gameplay.
- The player can improve their performance with each playthrough, refining their skills, learning from past attempts, and striving for better results (e.g., higher scores or faster completion times).

#### Failure:
- The game feels repetitive after a few playthroughs because the gameplay doesn’t change in meaningful ways, offering little variation or novelty.
- The player quickly becomes bored or frustrated because the game starts to feel predictable or stagnant.
- Randomness or variations don’t sufficiently affect gameplay in a way that encourages further play, making the game feel too predictable.
